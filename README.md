abstract = "Whereas type-1 and type-2 membership functions (MFs) are the core of any fuzzy logic system, there are no performance criteria available to evaluate the goodness or correctness of the fuzzy MFs. In this paper, we make extensive analysis in terms of the capability of type-2 elliptic fuzzy MFs in modeling uncertainty. Having decoupled parameters for its support and width, elliptic MFs are unique amongst existing type-2 fuzzy MFs. In this investigation, the uncertainty distribution along the elliptic MF support is studied, and a detailed analysis is given to compare and contrast its performance with existing type-2 fuzzy MFs. Furthermore, fuzzy arithmetic operations are also investigated, and our finding is that the elliptic MF has similar features to the Gaussian and triangular MFs in addition and multiplication operations. Moreover, we have tested the prediction capability of elliptic MFs using interval type-2 fuzzy logic systems on oil price prediction problem for a data set from 2nd Jan 1985 till 25th April 2016. Throughout the simulation studies, an extreme learning machine is used to train the interval type-2 fuzzy logic system. The prediction results show that, in addition to their various advantages mentioned above, elliptic MFs have comparable prediction results when compared to Gaussian and triangular MFs. Finally, in order to test the performance of fuzzy logic controller with elliptic interval type-2 MFs, extensive real-time experiments are conducted for the 3D trajectory tracking problem of a quadrotor. We believe that the results of this study will open the doors to elliptic MFs’ wider use of real-world identification and control applications as the proposed MF is easy to interpret in addition to its unique features."

abstract = "Although a considerable amount of effort has been put in to show that fuzzy logic controllers have exceptional capabilities of dealing with uncertainty, there are still noteworthy concerns, e.g., the design of fuzzy logic controllers is an arduous task due to the lack of closed-form input–output relationships which is a limitation to interpretability of these controllers. The role of design parameters in fuzzy logic controllers, such as position, shape, and height of membership functions, is not straightforward. Motivated by the fact that the availability of an interpretable relationship from input to output will simplify the design procedure of fuzzy logic controllers, the main aims in this work are derive fuzzy mappings for both type-1 and interval type-2 fuzzy logic controllers, analyse them, and eventually benefit from such a nonlinear mapping to design fuzzy logic controllers. Thereafter, simulation and real-time experimental results support the presented theoretical findings."

abstract="In this work, a learning model-free control method is proposed for accurate trajectory tracking and safe landing of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). A realistic scenario is considered where the UAV commutes between stations at high-speeds, experiences a single motor failure while surveying an area, and thus requires to land safely at a designated secure location. The proposed challenge is viewed solely as a control problem. A hybrid control architecture -- an artificial neural network (ANN)-assisted proportional-derivative controller -- is able to learn the system dynamics online and compensate for the error generated during different phases of the considered scenario: fast and agile flight, motor failure, and safe landing. Firstly, it deals with unmodelled dynamics and operational uncertainties and demonstrates superior performance compared to a conventional proportional-integral-derivative controller during fast and agile flight. Secondly, it behaves as a fault-tolerant controller for a single motor failure case in a coaxial hexacopter thanks to its proposed sliding mode control theory-based learning architecture. Lastly, it yields reliable performance for a safe landing at a secure location in case of an emergency condition. The tuning of weights is not required as the structure of the ANN controller starts to learn online, each time it is initialised, even when the scenario changes -- thus, making it completely model-free. Moreover, the simplicity of the neural network-based controller allows for the implementation on a low-cost low-power onboard computer. Overall, the real-time experiments show that the proposed controller outperforms the conventional controller.",

The proposed controller is used to control and stabilize a quadrotor unmanned aerial vehicle in the presence of periodic wind gust. A proportional-derivative controller is firstly introduced based on which fuzzy neural network is able to learn the quadrotor’s control model on-line. The proposed design allows handling uncertainties and lack of modelling at a computationally inexpensive cost. The parameter update rules of the learning algorithms are derived based on a Levenberg–Marquardt inspired approach, and the proof of the stability of two proposed control laws are verified by using the Lyapunov stability theory. In order to evaluate the performance of the proposed controllers extensive simulations and real-time experiments are conducted. The 3D trajectory tracking problem for a quadrotor is considered in the presence of time-varying wind conditions."
